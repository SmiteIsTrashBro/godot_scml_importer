# Godot SCML Importer

Godot is an awesome engine. Anyone using it deserves to be able to use the excellent resource and tools that exist along-side it. 
ne of these is Spriter from BrashMonkey. I had access to a number of animated character that I wanted to use with Godot and
I didn't want to need to recreate the animations that I already had.

## Usage
 * install plugin
 * enable plugin
 * import scml along with images maintaining the relativity that the SCML expects
 * Find and click the "Import SCML" button
 * Pick where to save the Godot scene file
 * Open and tweak the scene file in any way you want

## Tested/supported
 * SCML generator version r11

# Not currently supported
 * absolute values as found in e.g. generator version b5.95 that the GreyGuy sample comes with
